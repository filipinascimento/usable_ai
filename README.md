# Welcome to our Usable AI Course!

This course provides an in-depth introduction to Usable Artificial Inteligence, emphasizing practical skills and real-world applications. You’ll learn to implement essential AI techniques across various fields, using Python and popular libraries to enhance your ability to analyze, optimize, and communicate data-driven insights in areas like social science, sustainability, health, and design.

As AI becomes increasingly more integrated in our data workflows, understanding how to use these tools effectively is essential. In addition to foundational techniques, we will also explore emerging tools like large language models (LLMs), which can support tasks such as summarization and text analysis. LLMs offer a unique way to make sense of complex information and can be particularly useful for communicating findings to a wider audience.

This course is heavily based on Prof. Patrick C. Shih Usable AI course.

## Course Context

In the last decade, data generated from the Internet, sensors, wearables, and online communities has exploded, creating immense opportunities to empirically study social, behavioral, and environmental phenomena. This course will equip you with the AI tools needed to work with “big social data” and beyond, enabling you to derive insights from complex datasets.

Our interdisciplinary approach spans AI applications to real-world issues in behavioral research, health, environmental studies, and design. Alongside other quantitative methods, you will briefly engage with LLMs to explore how they can complement traditional data analysis and presentation methods.

## Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
 - Develop foundational knowledge in AI and machine learning for real-world data analysis.
 - Utilize Python libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning, Pandas and NumPy for data handling, and Matplotlib and others for visualization.
 - Prepare and manipulate basic data types, including numerical, categorical, and textual data, to make datasets ready for analysis.
 - Analyze data using exploratory visualization techniques to identify patterns, trends, and insights.
 - Perform data cleaning and transformation, including merging, reshaping, and aggregating datasets.
 - Apply essential machine learning models for tasks like classification, clustering, and regression using scikit-learn.
 - Understand and apply basic feature engineering techniques, such as dimensionality reduction, to enhance model performance.
 - Have a basic knowledge of deep learning architectures and basic embedding/vectorial representations of data.
 - Explore fundamental NLP techniques using libraries like NLTK and spaCy to work with textual data.
 - Use large language models (LLMs) for general machine learning tasks using local or API-based models. (optional modules)


You will showcase your learned skills by undertaking a semester-long project. This project will require detailed documentation of each step involved in its development, from initial concept to final execution.

### Course Structure

Each week, we'll explore different topics in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, starting from the basics and gradually moving to more advanced concepts. The course is designed to be hands-on, with a mix of theory, practical exercises, and projects.

Here's a tentative outline of the course for Spring 2025:

### Grades
You will be evaluated based on performance in assignments and final project. The final grade will be calculated as follows:

 - 30% - Assignments
 - 35% - Midterm project
 - 35% - Final project

An extra 10% will be given for active participation on online discussions, such as github contributions, slack discussions, asking questions, helping others, and contributing to the course materials

Grades will not be curved and will be based on the following scale:

```
93.00 - 100% = A
90.00 - 92.99% = A-
87.00 - 89.99% = B+
83.00 - 86.99% = B
80.00 - 82.99% = B-
77.00 - 79.99% = C+
73.00 - 76.99% = C
70.00 - 72.99% = C-
67.00 - 69.99% = D+
63.00 - 66.99% = D
60.00 - 62.99% = D-
<60.00 = F
```

### Communication

We will use Canvas and GitHub for all course materials, assignments, and for the projects. Slack will be used for communication, discussions, and to provide feedback on assignments and projects. We encourage you to actively participate in discussions, ask questions, and share your thoughts and ideas. Please be respectful and considerate of others' opinions and ideas, also do not post your personal information or sensitive data in the Slack channel.

Slack Channel for the course: [TBD]

Canvas and Email also work for communication but with a certain delay. We encourage you to use Slack for faster communication.

If you have suggestions, criticism or feedback on improving the course, please feel free to share them with us. You can use Slack or use the anonymous feedback form: [TBD].

## Course project
You can choose your own project topic (individually or as a team), but it is recommended to discuss your choice with the instructor first. For the project, you will need to submit a final report detailing your findings and explaining your approach to creating them. Throughout the course, you will work on a group project, which involves researching, designing, analyzing, and using machine learning pipelines on data sets related to a chosen problem area.

A timeline for each project stage will be provided, as the project requires both designing and executing data collection and analysis. Given this fast-paced schedule, each phase has only a few weeks allocated, so careful time management is essential.

## Setting Up Your Usable AI Environment

We suggest using miniconda to install python packages and setup your environment. You can also use Anaconda, but it is a larger package and may take longer to install. Alternatively, you can also setup your own python environment using pip and virtualenv.

### Step 1: Install Miniconda

Miniconda is a minimal installer for Conda, a package manager and an environment manager. Here’s how to install it:

1. **Download Miniconda**:
   - Visit the [Miniconda download page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
   - Choose the version suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Download the appropriate installer (Python 3.x is recommended).

2. **Install Miniconda**:
   - **Windows**: Run the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - **macOS/Linux**: Open a terminal, navigate to the folder containing the downloaded file, and run `bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh` (adjust the filename as needed).

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   - Open a new terminal window.
   - Type `conda list`. If Miniconda is installed correctly, you'll see a list of installed packages.

### Step 2: Create a Conda Environment

Creating a separate environment for your Data Science projects is good practice:

1. **Create a New Environment for this course**:
    - Run the command: `conda env create -f environment.yml`. This will create a new environment called datascience with all the necessary packages installed.

2. **Activate the Environment**:
   - Run: `conda activate datascience`.

3. **Launch Jupyter Lab**:
   - Run: `jupyter lab`.
   - This will open Jupyter Lab in your default web browser.

### Step 3: Manually Install Essential Packages

The created environment already includes most of the packages we'll need, but if you need to install any additional packages, here's how:

1. **Manually Install Packages **:
   - In your activated environment, run: `conda install <name of the package>` to install the packages
   - For example, to install the `scikit-learn` package, run: `conda install scikit-learn`.
   - Alternatively, you can use `pip install <name of the package>` to install packages from PyPI.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Make sure everything is installed correctly:

1. **Open a New Notebook in Jupyter Lab**:
   - In Jupyter Lab, create a new notebook.

2. **Test the Packages**:
   - Try importing the packages: `import numpy as np`, `import pandas as pd`, `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`.
   - If there are no errors, the packages are installed correctly.

### Additional Tips

- **Updating Conda**: Keep Conda and your packages updated with `conda update conda` and `conda update --all`.
- **Managing Environments**: View your environments with `conda env list` and switch between them using `conda activate <env_name>`.
- **Finding Packages**: To find available packages, use `conda search <package_name>`.
- **Conda Cheat Sheet**: For more commands, see the [Conda Cheat Sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html).
