# Welcome to our Usable AI Course!

This course provides an in-depth introduction to Usable Artificial Inteligence, emphasizing practical skills and real-world applications. You’ll learn to implement essential AI techniques across various fields, using Python and popular libraries to enhance your ability to analyze, optimize, and communicate data-driven insights in areas like social science, sustainability, health, and design.

As AI becomes increasingly more integrated in our data workflows, understanding how to use these tools effectively is essential. In addition to foundational techniques, we will also explore emerging tools like large language models (LLMs), which can support tasks such as summarization and text analysis. LLMs offer a unique way to make sense of complex information and can be particularly useful for communicating findings to a wider audience.

This course is heavily based on Prof. Patrick C. Shih Usable AI course.

## Course Context

In the last decade, data generated from the Internet, sensors, wearables, and online communities has exploded, creating immense opportunities to empirically study social, behavioral, and environmental phenomena. This course will equip you with the AI tools needed to work with “big social data” and beyond, enabling you to derive insights from complex datasets.

Our interdisciplinary approach spans AI applications to real-world issues in behavioral research, health, environmental studies, and design. Alongside other quantitative methods, you will briefly engage with LLMs to explore how they can complement traditional data analysis and presentation methods.

## Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
 - Develop foundational knowledge in AI and machine learning for real-world data analysis.
 - Utilize Python libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning, Pandas and NumPy for data handling, and Matplotlib and others for visualization.
 - Prepare and manipulate basic data types, including numerical, categorical, and textual data, to make datasets ready for analysis.
 - Analyze data using exploratory visualization techniques to identify patterns, trends, and insights.
 - Perform data cleaning and transformation, including merging, reshaping, and aggregating datasets.
 - Apply essential machine learning models for tasks like classification, clustering, and regression using scikit-learn.
 - Understand and apply basic feature engineering techniques, such as dimensionality reduction, to enhance model performance.
 - Have a basic knowledge of deep learning architectures and basic embedding/vectorial representations of data.
 - Explore fundamental NLP techniques using libraries like NLTK and spaCy to work with textual data.
 - Use large language models (LLMs) for general machine learning tasks using local or API-based models. (optional modules)


You will showcase your learned skills by undertaking a semester-long project. This project will require detailed documentation of each step involved in its development, from initial concept to final execution.


## Course Organization

This course combines lectures, hands-on exercises, and a team-based project. Lectures introduce key AI methods, including an introduction to LLMs for specific applications. In labs, you’ll receive guidance on data analysis and gain experience with a range of AI tools.

Your team-based project will involve designing, analyzing, and presenting data insights on a chosen topic. Projects will include data collection, AI-driven analysis, and visualization to create impactful narratives, with a structured timeline for each stage to keep you on track.

### Prerequisites
In this course, we will primarily use Python for data analysis and machine learning tasks. Thus, you are required to have a good understanding of algorithms and practical experience with Python. You are encouraged to also have a basic understanding of statistics and probability, as well as notions of linear algebra.

### Course Structure

Each week, we'll explore different topics in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, starting from the basics and gradually moving to more advanced concepts. The course is designed to be hands-on, with a mix of theory, practical exercises, and projects.

Here's a tentative outline of the course for Spring 2025:

### Grades
You will be evaluated based on performance in assignments and final project. The final grade will be calculated as follows:

 - 30% - Assignments
 - 35% - Midterm project
 - 35% - Final project

An extra 10% will be given for active participation on online discussions, such as github contributions, slack discussions, asking questions, helping others, and contributing to the course materials

Grades will not be curved and will be based on the following scale:

```
93.00 - 100% = A
90.00 - 92.99% = A-
87.00 - 89.99% = B+
83.00 - 86.99% = B
80.00 - 82.99% = B-
77.00 - 79.99% = C+
73.00 - 76.99% = C
70.00 - 72.99% = C-
67.00 - 69.99% = D+
63.00 - 66.99% = D
60.00 - 62.99% = D-
<60.00 = F
```

### Communication

We will use Canvas and GitHub for all course materials, assignments, and for the projects. Slack will be used for communication, discussions, and to provide feedback on assignments and projects. We encourage you to actively participate in discussions, ask questions, and share your thoughts and ideas. Please be respectful and considerate of others' opinions and ideas, also do not post your personal information or sensitive data in the Slack channel.

Canvas and Email also work for communication but with a certain delay. We encourage you to use Slack for faster communication.

If you have suggestions, criticism or feedback on improving the course, please feel free to share them with us. You can use Slack or use the anonymous feedback form: [https://forms.gle/HQmpgVRfc6USV48L6]

## Course project
You can choose your own project topic (individually or as a team), but it is recommended to discuss your choice with the instructor first. For the project, you will need to submit a final report detailing your findings and explaining your approach to creating them. Throughout the course, you will work on a group project, which involves researching, designing, analyzing, and using machine learning pipelines on data sets related to a chosen problem area.

A timeline for each project stage will be provided, as the project requires both designing and executing data collection and analysis. Given this fast-paced schedule, each phase has only a few weeks allocated, so careful time management is essential.

#### Policy on the Use of Generative AI and LLMs

In accordance with [IU’s Generative AI Policies](https://teaching.iu.edu/resources/generative-ai/policies.html), you have the instructor **permission** to use generative AI (GAI) and large language models (LLMs), including GPT, Gemini, Llama, Copilot, and similar tools, in this course as long as you do so responsibly and transparently. This includes tasks such as code completion, brainstorming, or improving the clarity of your text. However, these tools are **not recommended for fully automating** assignments or drafting entire project reports. Keep in mind that the quality of GAI output can be unreliable, and you remain fully accountable for any inaccuracies, biases, or offensive content you submit.

- **Disclosure**: If GAI usage played a substantial role in shaping your work, you must clearly acknowledge it. Provide a brief description of how you used the tool, and if it was essential to your final result, include a copy of the prompt(s).
- **Citation Example** (no particular format required beyond basic transparency):

  > OpenAI. (2024). *ChatGPT (Mar 14 version)* [Large language model]. [https://chat.openai.com/chat](https://chat.openai.com/chat)

- **Verification**: For code generated by AI, make sure it does exactly what you intend. You must be able to explain its logic and functionality; “blindly trusting” AI outputs is strongly discouraged.
- **Limitations**: No GAI tools may be used during exams or project presentations. Doing so will be considered a violation of course policies.
- **Integrity**: Use of GAI without proper acknowledgment can be treated as plagiarism or cheating.

> **Note**: There is currently no IU-approved or otherwise reliable method to detect AI-generated content. Some GAI systems can produce excessively verbose or uniquely structured text, but this is not consistent or guaranteed. We rely on your honesty and accurate self-reporting regarding the use of these tools.

In short, while GAI can streamline your workflow, it is **not** a substitute for human critical thinking. Leverage these tools thoughtfully, verify their outputs, and be prepared to justify your methods.
