# VS Code Start Guide

## Introduction
Visual Studio Code is a practical choice for our Usable AI course. It supports running Python notebooks and provides essential tools for project management through its integrated GitHub features. This approach makes managing code and projects straightforward without unnecessary complexity. You can also customize the editor to suit your preferences and workflow and use it across different operating systems, even remotely.
